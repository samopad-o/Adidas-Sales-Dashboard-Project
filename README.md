# Adidas-Sales-Dashboard-Project
An interactive dashboard that transforms raw Adidas sales data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decisions for optimizing sales strategy and boosting profitability. Built with Microsoft Excel.
## Introduction
I created this dashboard to tell the story behind Adidas' sales from 2020–2021. It shows how products performed, which regions brought in the most revenue, and how sales varied over time. This project helped me improve my Excel skills, especially with pivot tables, slicers, and clean formatting, and gave me a better understanding of building dashboards that actually communicate insights, not just numbers.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains comprehensive Adidas sales records across various regions, product, and retailers. Key fields include:
* Invoice Dates
* Region
* Product Categories
* Sales Methods
* Operating Margins
* Total Sales Values
## Dataset Source
This dataset was originally sourced from Kaggle's Adidas Sales Dataset. It contains Adidas retail sales data from 2020–2021. It is meant for educational purposes only.
## Objective
The primary goal of this dashboard was to analyze Adidas sales performance across the US by retailer, region, product, and sales method. The aim was to identify **growth opportunities** and strategies to **improve profitability**.
Key tasks involved:
* **Data Cleaning**
* **Feature Engineering**
* **Interactive Dashboards**
* **Consistent Formatting & Branding** (Adidas themed)
## Data Cleaning
Before visualizing the data, I performed the following crucial cleaning steps in Excel:
* Converted the dataset into a Excel Table.
* Removed all empty rows and columns.
* Checked for and handled missing values using filters.
* Identified and addressed duplicate entries.
* Created two new insightful columns from the Invoice Date:
    * Month
    * Day of the Week
    * Applied consistent formatting (e.g., currency for sales figures, general text for categorical fields).
## Charts & Visualizations
The dashboard include the following visuals, all designed with a consistent aesthetic using different shades of gray to align with the Adidas brand theme:
